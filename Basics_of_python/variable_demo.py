# this program is about basics of variable
#variable names are names given to data or reference to data
# we don't data type in python to declare variable
a=15 #assigning of a to 15
name="madhu" #here name is refering madhu
age= 20 # here age is refering value 20
# we cannot declare a variable with out assigning data
print(a,name,age) #output : 15 madhu 20

#declaring and initialize multiple variables in single line
name1,price,weight="tomato",20,5
print(name1,price,weight) #output : tomato 20 5

#declaring and initialising multiple variables with equal value

x=y=z=1

print(x,y,z) #output : 1 1 1
